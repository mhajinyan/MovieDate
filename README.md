# Project Overview

**In this data analysis project, I examine movie performance and trends from 2012 to 2016. By reviewing multiple variables, my goal is to uncover patterns, generate data-informed recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the film industry's dynamics.**

## Data Overview
Movie Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Movie Data.xmls" file, containing detailed information about each movie's performance, actors, directors, and other relevant details. The results are in the new file that has a new spreadsheet "Dashboard" with the charts and slicers representing data analysis: [Movies Data and Dashboard.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20746857/Movies.Data.and.Dashboard.xlsx)

## Tools

Excel Power Query for Data Cleaning.
Excel Pivot Tables for Data Analysis, Creating Reports, and Visualizations.
